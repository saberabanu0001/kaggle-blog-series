# kaggle-blog-series
This is not just a blog series—it’s a learning journal.

Every notebook here is inspired by a real challenge I faced while learning data science. Whether it was cleaning messy data, choosing the right model, or understanding evaluation metrics, I turned each struggle into a blog that others can learn from.

I’ll keep adding new posts as I explore more topics, tackle new competitions, and grow my skills. If you’ve ever felt stuck or unsure, I hope these blogs help you find clarity—just like they helped me.
